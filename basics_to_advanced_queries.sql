-- For each Diagnosis, what is the median length of stay(Note: median is harder in SQL than average, often requiring window functions or specific dialect functions)?
-- Calculate a "Doctor Performance Score" where the score is `(Average Feedback 0.6) + (Number of Unique Patients Treated 0.4 / Max Patients Treated by Any Doctor)`. (This requires defining a custom formula and potentially subqueries to get max values).
-- What is the month-over-month growth rate of patient admissions?
-- Are there any Doctors who consistently receive low Feedback scores (e.g., average < 3) across multiple different diagnoses(e.g., for at least 3 distinct diagnoses they handle)?
-- Which Diagnosis has the highest variance or standard deviation in Billing_Amounts?
-- Identify peak admission days/timesif `Admit_Date` also contained a time component (not specified, but a common advanced analysis).
